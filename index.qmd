title: "Sports Dataverse Examples"
---

An increasing number of students are interested in sports data, so I want to learn more about different R packages that help gather that data.

Some of these are within the [Sports Dataverse](https://www.sportsdataverse.org/packages), but I'm also finding that some of those packages do not work.

> See the site navigation for the different examples I have.

Some I've had some success with:

- [worldfootballR](https://jaseziv.github.io/worldfootballR/) for world soccer.
- [baseballR](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) for baseball.

Some I've seen work in the past but I haven't used recently:

- [recruitR](https://recruitr.sportsdataverse.org/) for college sports recruits.
- [cfbfastR](https://cfbfastr.sportsdataverse.org/) for college football stats. Requires an API key.

Some that have NOT worked:

- [usfootballR](https://usfootballr.sportsdataverse.org/) but that information seems to be available in [worldfootballR](https://jaseziv.github.io/worldfootballR/)
