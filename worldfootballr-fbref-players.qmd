Getting standard player stats. Goal is to look into cards.

## Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(worldfootballR)
```


## Player stats

This is for all players in European top flight leagues for one year.

```{r}
big5_player_stats_21 <- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(
  season_end_year=2021,
  stat_type="standard",
  team_or_player="player",
  time_pause = 3) |>
  clean_names()
```

```{r}
big5_player_stats_21
```

That result could be treated like [Team stats](worldfootballr-fbref-teamstats.qmd) and turned into a function to download multiple years.
